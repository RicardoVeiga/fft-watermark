fft-watermark
=============

Fork from the code for the post ["The Two-Dimensional Fourier Transform and Digital Watermarking"](http://jeremykun.com/2013/12/30/the-two-dimensional-fourier-transform-and-digital-watermarking/)

Motivation for this fork came from this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/opencv/comments/meym5d/question_is_there_a_way_to_replicate_this_fourier/

Updated to Python 3.8.

Added a progressbar and an automatic gif generator. [not optimal results, work in progress]
